- [ ] Add/remove a board

### Then, web interface (web edit -> file update)
- [ ] Leptos hello world
- [ ] Render markdown myself (so I can edit it easily without another lib)
      (Or maybe use [leptos-markdown](https://github.com/rambip/leptos-markdown)? It supports [custom
      components](https://github.com/rambip/leptos-markdown/blob/main/examples/custom_component/src/main.rs))
      (Also note the same author made [dioxus-markdown](https://github.com/rambip/dioxus-markdown))
