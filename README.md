# markanban - markdown kanban board

Should implement the spec in https://github.com/todomd/todo.md

As such, see the TODO.md file for an example (it's the todo for this app)

(Note: is this the same as https://github.com/todo-md/todo-md? Is the difference only "##" vs "###" for each task list?)

(Also note [there is a vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=coddx.coddx-alpha) that works exactly like this kanban
board should work)
