### Ok uhm

I am not using this very consistently right now but that's ok, that's what's
this tool is for...

Stuff relegated to a distant future can be found in `BACKLOG.md`. When it's time
to do something *now*, it is moved here.

- [ ] Modify the UI to display markdown files in a debug mode, highlighting the
      background of portions of text that correspond to a given node's span.
  - [ ] Display simple markdown text, using
        [leptos-markdown](https://github.com/rambip/leptos-markdown). But uhhh,
        here is a blocker: [leptos-markdown doesn't support leptos
        0.7](https://github.com/rambip/leptos-markdown/issues/16)
  - [ ] Add a way to highlight some spans
